1. The main focus of this application is to allow the restaurant managers easily manage their guests reservations. The main features include:

1. Edit: Once a reservation has been created the user will be redirected to the dashboard page of the date of that reservation. The reservation card on that page will include options to seat, edit, or cancel the reservation.
